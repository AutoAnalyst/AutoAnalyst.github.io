# Dartmouth CS 65 Final Project 

## Auto Analyst 

As the use of technology in the workplace becomes ever more ubiquitous, there are some monotonous aspects of everyday jobs that have been done manually for too long. One such example is the manual transition of data from a physical copy of some data to excel. In many financial services fields, firms are given physical copies of data on meeting clients, acquisition targets, and so on. To evaluate the value of the party/parties on the opposite side of the negotiation table, this data must be transferred into a model of some sort on excel. The goal of this application is to automate this process.

### Goals 

1.  By simply taking a picture of the data you need, 'Auto Analyst' is able to send you a excel sheet with all the values already filled. That way you can get right to modelling instead of spending a few hours on manually copying all the data. We expect to reach this stage by the deadline of the class project.

2. A 3-Statement Model Module, when selected, will be able to detect two out of the following in the images taken: 
   *  balance sheet 
   *  income statement 
   *  cash flow statement

Once the data is converted, the app will use the two detected models to create the missing sheet, and then set up the relational equations between each value for future prediction. This is modelling in easy mode, all you have to do is input your constants. This is a stretch goal of the project and the goal of completion (if the project is pursued) is by the end of June.

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
